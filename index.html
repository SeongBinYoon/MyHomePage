		<p>Description: We made our team 'Kimmessicorp' in OpenSource Software Development class, and the name of our team is from teammate's family name 'Kim' plus, the world's famous soccer player 'Messi'. The most significantly, I'm pretty sure that we are good at communication, fit and support well each other because of numerous failures and successes. It is very pleasure to be with together again.
